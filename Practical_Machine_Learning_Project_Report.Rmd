## Overview
This project is dedicated to analysis

## Pre-modelling setup and data overview 
First one can load all libraries that will be required for the following analysis and to set a seed to ensure reproducibility:
```{r, echo=TRUE,warning=FALSE}
library(lattice)
library(ggplot2)
library(caret)

set.seed(135)
```

There are two available data sets: training one and testing one. One can load the data and check the data structure:
```{r}
training <- read.csv("pml-training.csv")
testing <- read.csv("pml-testing.csv")

dim(training)
dim(testing)
```

In total, there are 160 variables and 19622/20 observations in the training/testing sets.
